#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Write a Bash script that displays:
# The content of the current directory
# In a list format
# Where only the part of the name after the first dash is displayed (refer to the example)
# Requirements:
# You must use the for loop (while and until are forbidden)
# Do not display hidden files
for file in *; do
    # Check if the file is not hidden and contains a dash in the name
    if [ ! -f "$file" ] || [[ "$file" == .* ]] || [[ ! "$file" =~ - ]]; then
        continue
    fi

    # Extract the part of the name after the first dash
    name=$(echo "$file" | cut -d'-' -f2-)
    
    # Print the extracted name
    echo "$name"
done
